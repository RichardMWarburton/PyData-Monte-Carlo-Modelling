# Python & Ladders: An Introduction to Monte Carlo Modelling

This repo contains the files used and presented during the Exeter PyData MeetUp on the 17th April 2024

## Abstract: 

Monte Carlo modelling is a computational technique used in various fields, including finance, engineering, physics, and statistics, to simulate and analyse complex systems or processes.  It works by generating random samples or simulations of the system's inputs, often following specified probability distributions, and then approximating the system's behaviour by collating results over numerous samples.  With its origins in the Manhattan Project, the method is named after the famous Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, reflecting the element of chance inherent in the technique.  This talk introduces Monte Carlo modelling through the random game of Snakes & Ladders and simple Python code, before exploring real-life applications.
